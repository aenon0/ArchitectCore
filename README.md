HR Leave Managment: Clean Architecture .NET Core Project

Overview:
This repository houses a .NET Core project I developed while honing my skills in Clean Architecture. Clean Architecture is an architectural pattern that promotes maintainability, testability, and separation of concerns in software development. This project is intended as an educational resource for individuals interested in Clean Architecture principles and .NET Core development.

Project Highlights:
Clean Architecture Structure: This project follows the principles of Clean Architecture, separating the application into distinct layers, including Domain, Application, and Infrastructure, to ensure a clean and modular codebase.
Dependency Injection: Learn how to use dependency injection for achieving loose coupling and enhancing testability.
Best Practices: Explore examples of best practices for clean code, adherence to SOLID principles, and effective separation of concerns.

Prerequisites:
To make the most of this project, a fundamental understanding of .NET Core and software architectural patterns is recommended. This repository is an invaluable resource for those looking to deepen their knowledge of Clean Architecture and its application in .NET Core projects.
